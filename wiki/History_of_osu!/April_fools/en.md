# List of osu! April Fools' day jokes

*For the complete history of osu!, see: [History of osu!](/wiki/History_of_osu!)*

Every year, the osu! developers like to play pranks on the community on April Fools' day. This article contains a list of all the April Fools' day jokes that were played on the osu! community since 2009.

## 2009

### "Lemon Tree" gets ranked

[Best of No.1 Hits - Lemon Tree (MillhioreF)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/57878) was ranked on 1 April 2009. The beatmap was very much a joke beatmap with users saracastically claiming that such a map should be kept ranked forever. It's ranked status was removed by moderators shortly afterwards.

After some time, the original beatmap was removed on request of its creator; the beatmap was reuploaded on 24 Aug 2012 by [MillhioreF](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/941094) (linked above) for archival purposes.

## 2010

### touhosu!

On 1 April 2010, the osu! website along with the main menu screen was changed to theme with the [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project "Wikipedia") (shown below). The changes included the inclusion of the character Marisa Kirisam, the display of differently-coloured butterflies in a circular pattern across the main menu and website, along with the swapping of the name "osu!" to "touhosu!" in certain areas across the website (shown below).

![](img/2010-touhosu-main-screen.jpg "Screenshot of a user's main screen in osu! on 1 April 2010")

![](img/2010-touhosu-website.jpg "Screenshot of the osu! website on 1 April 2009")

The joke largely stems from a [long-standing feature request](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/19307) to create a game mode based off of the currently-existing osu!catch game mode, and the core gameplay from the Touhou Project.

There was also a report at the time of [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) jokingly remarking that buying an osu!supporter tag would show a naked Marisa Kirisame on the main menu screen instead of a fully clothed one.

## 2011

### osu!core

osu!core is the name given to osu!'s 2011 April Fools' day prank. The prank caused every single map's audio to be pitched and sped up in the style of [Nightcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightcore "Wikipedia") remixes. Although just an April Fools' day prank, it later became a reality when the [Nightcore mod](/wiki/Game_modifier/Nightcore) was introduced as an actual playable mod in osu!. Videos of the event in question can be accessed in the references section below.

## 2012

### Flashlight/Hidden mod on website

On 1 April 2012, the entire osu! website had a 50% chance of either the Flashlight mod or Hidden mod being "enabled" on the site per page load (3/10 for Hidden; 1/5 for Flashlight). A modern recreation of what the prank looked like for users at the time is shown below.

### Bad Apple ranking chart

On 1 April 2012, [a newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/79128?start=1431905) was released announcing the brand new addition of the "Bad Apple Ranking Chart." An excerpt of the newspost is enscribed below:

> We decided to dedicate this chart to the greatest song and video ever created, Bad Apple!!. You can find the awesome chart here
>
> Now, as this is a chart of epic proportions, we needed to make our prize a little better this time! The winners will receive a Lily White poster and a hand drawn picture of Reimu. (A printer is required to receive these prizes)
>
> Look forward to our next charts, the Renai Circulation and Irony charts!

— Cyclone, "Bad Apple Ranking Chart!"

The ranking chart was real at the time and displayed the top 40 players who obtained the highest ranked score obtained in any one of the handpicked selection of "Bad Apple!!" beatmaps. The chart was opened on 1 April 2012 and closed on 2 April 2012. At the end of the ranking period, player [Mesita](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/201459) was the number one player with a ranked score of 145,623,328.

The beatmaps included in the ranking chart are listed below:

- [nomico - Bad Apple!! (James)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/6252)
- [REDALiCE - Bad Apple!! (Rena-chan)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/10353)
- [Masayoshi Minoshima ft. nomico - Bad Apple!! (Ephemeral)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/10435)
- [Masayoshi Minoshima ft. nomico - Bad Apple!! (ignorethis)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/13177)
- [Masayoshi Minoshima feat. StrawbellyCake - Bad Apple!! (German Version) (Larto)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/13664)
- [Masayoshi Minoshima feat. Larto & nomico - Awesome Apple!! (Larto)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/14475)
- [Masayoshi Minoshima feat. nomico - Bad Apple!! (ouranhshc)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/18260)

- [Kommisar - Bad Apple!! (Chiptune Ver.) (Sushi)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/28222)
- [Kalafina - Bad MagiApple (Makar8000)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/32003)

The "Bad Apple!!" music video had been a some sort of an in-joke at the time with remixes of the song combined with other ironic twists being a prevalent occurence in beatmaps at the time, hence its appearance as an April Fools' joke.

## 2013

### BanchoBot becomes a tsundere

On 1 April 2013, BanchoBot was turned into a tsundere. On this April Fools', anytime users would issue a command to BanchoBot or prompt it to speak in a public chat, its chat messages would be replaced with stereotypical tsundere-like responses to a romantic interest. A difference in language between normal BanchoBot and "tsundere BanchoBot" is shown below.

## 2014

### Shiba Inu appears in osu!

On 1 April 2014, the osu! main menu screen was temporarily changed (shown below) to include multi-colored, grammatically incorrect statesments in the style of the [Doge meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme) "Wikipedia") that was popular at that time.

## 2015

### osu!coins

*See also: [osu!coin](/wiki/osu!coin)*

On 31 March 2015, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) released [a newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-03-31-osucoins) that announced the addition of a new in-game currency to be added to osu!, dubbed "osu!coins." In the newspost, peppy jokingly explained that his reasoning behind the change was due to the current monetary gain from player donations would not have been enough to buy him a personal jet within his lifetime:

> At the current rate of return, it would be unlikely for me to purchase a personal jet within my lifetime, which is one of my primary life goals. Thus I held discussions with the team on alternate forms of monetisation, studying the current trends in similar free-to-play games currently available on the market.

— peppy, "osu!coins"

*Note: Under [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Wikipedia"), the post was posted on 31 March 2015. However, at the time of the publication, peppy was currently living in Australia, in which the current date was 1 April 2015.*

The in-game currency and how it worked was detailed in the newspost iteself, along with a specially-created osu!academy video. In short, to play or restart a beatmap, users would have to use one osu!coin, and would once they ran out of osu!coins, they would either have to stop playing and wait for the next day, or pay with real money to get more osu!coins. However, acutal gameplay was not affected, and users could just continue playing as normal once all their osu!coins were depleted.

Shortly after the newspost was published, players would find themselves greeted with an osu! main screen that had a background of slowly falling osu!coins, along with a slightly changed main theme, in which the exclamation "circles!" was replaced with a robotic-sounding "and buy the coins" before the beat drop.

New textures, sound effects, and music were created for this prank, including an counter that would display the amount of coins players had throughout the map. There were also videos at the time which detailed bugs with the system that allowed users to gain infinite osu!coins.

it was the only high-quality video showing the osu!coins in there actual intended state, but was deleted on request of the creator. if anyone knows how to finaggle youtube to let me watch or download or get the original uploader's name, that would be very helpful. -->
