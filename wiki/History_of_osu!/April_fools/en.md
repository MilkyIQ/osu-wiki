# List of osu! April Fools' day jokes

*For the complete history of osu!, see: [History of osu!](/wiki/History_of_osu!)*

Every year, the osu! developers like to play pranks on the community on April Fools' day. This article contains a list of all the April Fools' day jokes that were played on the osu! community since 2009.

## 2009

### "Lemon Tree" gets ranked

On 1 April 2009 the [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) "Best of No.1 Hits - Lemon Tree (MillhioreF)" was ranked as part of that year's April Fools' joke by the developers. The beatmap's ranked status was revoked shortly and was very much a joke within the community with users saracastically claiming that such a beatmap should be kept ranked forever \[1,2,3]\. It's ranked status was removed by moderators shortly afterwards.

After some time, the original beatmap was removed on request of its creator; however, it was eventually reuploaded on 24 Aug 2012 by [MillhioreF](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/941094) for archival purposes \[4\].

## 2010

### touhosu!

For the 2010 April Fools' prank, the osu! website along with the in-game main menu screen was changed to theme with characters and references from the [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project "Wikipedia") (shown below). The changes included the addition of the character Marisa Kirisame and a display of differently-coloured butterflies in a circular pattern across the main menu and website, along with the swapping of the name "osu!" to "touhosu!" in certain areas across the website (shown below) \[1,2,3\].

![](img/2010-touhosu-website.jpg "Screenshot of the osu! website on 1 April 2009")

The joke largely stems from a [long-standing feature request](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/19307) to create a [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) based off of the currently-existing [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) game mode, and the core gameplay from the Touhou Project \[4\].

There was also a report at the time of [Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) jokingly remarking that buying an osu!supporter tag would show a naked Marisa Kirisame on the main menu screen instead of a fully clothed one, however this claim was only a joke and was quickly disproven by others \[5\].

## 2011

### osu!core

"osu!core" is the name given to osu!'s 2011 April Fools' day prank. The prank caused every single [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap)'s audio to be pitched and sped up in the style of [Nightcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightcore "Wikipedia") remixes. Although just an April Fools' day prank, it later became a reality when the [Nightcore mod](/wiki/Game_modifier/Nightcore) was introduced as an actual playable [game modifier](/wiki/Game_modifier) in osu! \[1,2,3,4\].

## 2012

### Flashlight/Hidden mod on website

On 1 April 2012, the entire osu! website had a 50% chance of either the [Flashlight (FL) mod](/wiki/Game_modifier/Flashlight) or [Hidden (HD) mod](/wiki/Game_modifier/Hidden) being "enabled" on the site per page load (3/10 for HD; 1/5 for FL). A modern recreation of what the prank looked like for users at the time is shown below \[1,2,3,4,5,6\].

### Bad Apple ranking chart

The "Bad Apple Ranking Chart" was a joke ranking chart based off of a variety of [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) that featured the song "Bad Apple!!" as part of osu!'s 2012 April Fools' joke. Announced via [a newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/79128?start=1431905) that was released on 1 April 2012 that, the ranking chart functioned as a real working chart at the time anddisplayed the top 40 players who obtained hte highest ranked score in any one of the handpicked selection of "Bad Apple!!" beatmps \[1,2,3\]. An excerpt from the aforementioned newspost is inscribed below:

> We decided to dedicate this chart to the greatest song and video ever created, Bad Apple!!. You can find the awesome chart here
>
> Now, as this is a chart of epic proportions, we needed to make our prize a little better this time! The winners will receive a Lily White poster and a hand drawn picture of Reimu. (A printer is required to receive these prizes)
>
> Look forward to our next charts, the Renai Circulation and Irony charts!

— Cyclone, "Bad Apple Ranking Chart!"

The chart was opened on 1 April 2012 and closed on 2 April 2012. At the end of the ranking period, player [Mesita](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/201459) was the number one player with a ranked score of 145,623,328 \[4\].

The beatmaps included in the ranking chart are listed below:

- [nomico - Bad Apple!! (James)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/6252)
- [REDALiCE - Bad Apple!! (Rena-chan)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/10353)

- [Kalafina - Bad MagiApple (Makar8000)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/32003)

The "Bad Apple!!" music video had been a some sort of an in-joke at the time with remixes of the song combined with other ironic twists being a prevalent occurence in beatmaps at the time, hence its appearance as an April Fools' joke. <!--citation needed-->

## 2013

### BanchoBot becomes a tsundere

On 1 April 2013, [BanchoBot](/wiki/BanchoBot) was turned into a [tsundere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere "Wikipedia"). On this April Fools' day, any time users would issue a command to BanchoBot or prompt it to speak in a public chat, its chat messages would be replaced with stereotypical tsundere-like responses to a romantic interest \[1,2,3,4,5,6\].

## 2014

### Shiba Inu appears in osu!

On 1 April 2014, the osu! main menu screen was temporarily changed (shown below) to include multi-coloured, grammatically incorrect statements accomapnied by the famous image of a certain [Shiba Inu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu "Wikipedia") in the style of the [Doge meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme) "Wikipedia") that was popular at that time \[1,2,3,4\].

## 2015 <!--stopped citing numbers here-->

### osu!coins

*See also: [osu!coin](/wiki/osu!coin)*

On 31 March 2015, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) released [a newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2015-03-31-osucoins) that announced the addition of a new in-game currency to be added to osu!, dubbed "osu!coins." In the newspost, peppy jokingly explained that his reasoning behind the change was due to the current monetary gain from player donations would not have been enough to buy him a personal jet within his lifetime:

> At the current rate of return, it would be unlikely for me to purchase a personal jet within my lifetime, which is one of my primary life goals. Thus I held discussions with the team on alternate forms of monetisation, studying the current trends in similar free-to-play games currently available on the market.

— peppy, "osu!coins"

*Note: Under [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Wikipedia"), the post was posted on 31 March 2015. However, at the time of the publication, peppy was currently living in Australia, in which the current date was 1 April 2015.*

The in-game currency and how it worked was detailed in the newspost iteself, along with a specially-created osu!academy video. In short, to play or restart a beatmap, users would have to use one osu!coin, and would once they ran out of osu!coins, they would either have to stop playing and wait for the next day, or pay with real money to get more osu!coins. However, acutal gameplay was not affected, and users could just continue playing as normal once all their osu!coins were depleted.

Shortly after the newspost was published, players would find themselves greeted with an osu! main screen that had a background of slowly falling osu!coins, along with a slightly changed main theme, in which the exclamation "circles!" was replaced with a robotic-sounding "and buy the coins" before the beat drop.

New textures, sound effects, and music were created for this prank, including an counter that would display the amount of coins players had throughout the map. There were also videos at the time which detailed bugs with the system that allowed users to gain infinite osu!coins.

## 2016

### osu! in virtual reality

On 1 April 2016, [a newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-04-01-oculus-rift-to-be-supported-as-an-input-method) was published detailing the announcement of plans to add support for the [Oculus Rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift "Wikipedia") as a new [input method](/wiki/Gameplay/Input_device) in osu!. The post, written by [Evrien](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/791660), referenced many quotes from a supposed interview of [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) that was conducted by [Flyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3103765) in which peppy explained his reasoning for the announcment and ideas for how the concept might work.

Regarding how players might use the Oculus Rift as an input method, the newspost describes that "the player will experience a first person point-of-view of the cursor as it travels to and from hit-objects on screen…" and will hit hit objects by "…having the player produce vowel-like sounds using their mouth." No actual in-game changes were made relating to using the Oculus Rift or a similar [virtual reality (VR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality "Wikipedia") device to control osu!.

However, even though the official osu! developers have/had no intention of genuinely adding VR support, the idea of osu! in VR piqued interest in the minds of some fans. This interest eventually culminated into an unofficial fan project that was started shortly afterwards to aimed to create a free and open-source client to play osu! [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) in VR. Named "[McOsu](https://store.steampowered.com/app/607260/McOsu "Steam")," the project was completed and released on [Steam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service) "Wikipedia") on 20 March 2017.

### Dancing Auto mod cursor/dancing pippi

"dancing pippi" (also known as "dancing Auto mod cursor") is the nickname given a 2016 osu! April Fools' joke in which an update was released that caused the game cursor in [Auto](/wiki/Game_modifier/Auto) mod [replays](/wiki/Replay) to circle around the current [hit object](/wiki/Hit_object) in pixel-perfect fashion before eventually hitting the object right on time. This is in contrast to the Auto mod's typical robotic, perfectly straight movements.
